## Core Principle

> **"We sell insights, not data."**
>
> If every feature follows this rule, the platform is compliant.

## 1. Core Legal Position

### 1.1 Data Ownership Acknowledgement

All underlying transaction data originates from publicly available and licensed sources, including URA REALIS. Intellectual property rights in the original datasets remain with their respective owners.

### 1.2 Transformative Use Statement

The information presented on this platform represents **derived analytics**, **aggregated insights**, and **proprietary calculations**, and does not reproduce or redistribute original transaction records.

### 1.3 Non-Reproduction Clause

This platform does not display, reproduce, or provide access to raw transaction-level data, unit-level records, or downloadable datasets.

### 1.4 Non-Substitution Clause

The platform is intended for analytical and informational purposes only and does not replace official URA publications or records.

---

## 2. Data Usage & Intellectual Property

### Data Sources & Intellectual Property Notice

This platform provides analytical insights derived from publicly available and licensed real estate data sources, including URA REALIS.

- All intellectual property rights in the original datasets remain with their respective owners.
- This platform does not reproduce, redistribute, or provide access to raw transaction-level data.
- All figures, charts, rankings, and indicators displayed on this platform represent derived analytics, aggregated metrics, and proprietary calculations generated independently by the platform.

---

## 3. Transformative Use Declaration

### Transformative Use Statement

The information presented on this platform constitutes **transformative analysis** based on aggregated market data. It does not replicate, substitute, or reproduce official transaction records or proprietary databases.

No individual transaction records, unit-level data, or downloadable datasets are made available.

---

## 4. Non-Redistribution & Non-Substitution

### Usage Limitation

This platform is intended solely for analytical and informational purposes. It is not intended to replace, replicate, or serve as a substitute for official URA publications, records, or subscription-based data services.

Users are not permitted to extract, reconstruct, or redistribute data displayed on the platform.

## 6. Analytics Methodology

### Methodology Overview

Metrics displayed on this platform are calculated using aggregated transaction data and statistical methods such as:

- Percentile ranking
- Z-score normalization
- Moving averages and trend analysis
- Relative performance indexing

**Key Points:**
- Results represent **relative market behavior**, not exact transaction outcomes
- All data is processed to **prevent reconstruction** of individual sales records
- Aggregation ensures no single transaction is identifiable

## 8. Terminology Guidelines

### Approved Terms

| Use This | Instead Of |
|----------|------------|
| Market benchmark | Transaction record |
| Observed trend | Sales history |
| Derived metric | URA data |
| Liquidity indicator | Exact price |
| Performance index | Transaction list |
| Relative ranking | Raw data |
| Aggregated performance | Transaction table |
| Liquidity signal | Unit record |

### Terms to Avoid

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "Transaction record" | Implies raw data access |
| "Sales history" | Suggests transaction-level detail |
| "URA data" | Claims direct data reproduction |
| "Exact price" | Implies raw values |
| "Transaction list" | Suggests enumerable records |
| "Download data" | Implies redistribution |

> **Language matters legally.** Terminology choices affect how the platform is perceived by regulators and data licensors.

## 10. Internal Compliance Checklist

### Pre-Launch Feature Review

Before launching any feature, answer these questions:

| Question | If YES |
|----------|--------|
| Does this feature show raw transaction data? | Redesign required |
| Can a user reconstruct URA records from this? | Redesign required |
| Does this look like a resale transaction table? | Redesign required |
| Does it allow copying/exporting data? | Redesign required |
| Does it mirror URA data structure? | Redesign required |
| Does the wording imply raw data access? | Revise terminology |

**Rule:** If any answer is YES, the feature must be redesigned before launch.

### Quick Compliance Test

Ask yourself:
1. Could someone copy-paste this into Excel and recreate transactions?
2. Does this screen show what looks like a database export?
3. Would a URA auditor consider this "redistribution"?

If any answer is YES, change it.

### The Litmus Test

Before shipping any feature, apply this test:

```
Does it look like DATA?     → Don't ship it
Does it EXPLAIN the data?   → Safe to ship
```

### Final Golden Rule

> **"We sell insights, not data."**
>
> - If it looks like data → don't ship it
> - If it explains the data → you're safe
>
> Every feature must pass this test.
