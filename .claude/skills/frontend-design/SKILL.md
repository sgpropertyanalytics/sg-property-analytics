# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Before Coding: Design Thinking

Before writing any code, establish context and commit to a bold aesthetic direction:

1. **Purpose** — What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
2. **Tone** — Select a distinctive aesthetic direction:
   - Minimalist / Maximalist
   - Brutalist / Art Deco
   - Retro-futuristic / Industrial
   - Luxury / Playful
   - Editorial / Organic
   - Soft pastel / High contrast
3. **Constraints** — Technical requirements, browser support, performance
4. **Differentiation** — What makes this unforgettable?

> "Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity."

## Execution Focus Areas

### Typography
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- Avoid generic defaults: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts
- Pair distinctive display fonts with refined body fonts
- Consider variable fonts for dynamic weight/width

### Color & Theme
- Build cohesive aesthetics using CSS variables
- Use dominant colors with sharp accents
- Avoid timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- Consider: dark modes, high contrast options

### Motion & Animation
Prioritize high-impact moments:
- Orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Hover surprises and micro-interactions
- Meaningful transitions (not decoration)

### Spatial Composition
Create unexpected, memorable layouts:
- Asymmetry and intentional imbalance
- Overlapping elements and layers
- Diagonal flow and broken grids
- Generous, purposeful whitespace

### Visual Details & Atmosphere
Layer contextual details:
- Gradient meshes and noise textures
- Geometric patterns
- Layered transparency
- Dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders
- Custom cursors
- Grain overlays

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Generic AI-generated aesthetics:**
- Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui)
- Clichéd color schemes (especially purple gradients)
- Predictable centered layouts
- Cookie-cutter card grids
- Generic hero sections with stock patterns
- Designs lacking context-specific character

## Implementation Checklist

```
BEFORE CODING:
[ ] Defined purpose and audience
[ ] Selected bold aesthetic direction
[ ] Identified what makes it distinctive

TYPOGRAPHY:
[ ] Chosen characterful fonts (not defaults)
[ ] Established clear hierarchy
[ ] Tested readability at all sizes

COLOR:
[ ] Built cohesive palette with CSS variables
[ ] Has dominant color + sharp accents
[ ] Tested contrast for accessibility

MOTION:
[ ] Added purposeful animations
[ ] Page load feels crafted
[ ] Interactions provide feedback
[ ] Respects prefers-reduced-motion

LAYOUT:
[ ] Uses unexpected spatial composition
[ ] Not a generic card grid
[ ] Whitespace is intentional

DETAILS:
[ ] Added atmospheric textures/effects
[ ] Visual details match aesthetic direction
[ ] Feels crafted, not templated
```

## Philosophy

Match code complexity to vision:
- Maximalist designs warrant elaborate animations
- Minimalist designs require precision in spacing and typography

Every design should feel genuinely crafted for its specific context rather than templated.
