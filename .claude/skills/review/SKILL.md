# Code Review Orchestrator

Comprehensive code review workflow that catches issues BEFORE pushing.

**Trigger:** `/review`, "review this", "check my changes"

---

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

> **YOU MUST EXECUTE EVERY STEP BELOW. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.**
>
> 1. **USE THE TASK TOOL** to call agents in Steps 1-4
> 2. **USE THE BASH TOOL** to run tests in Step 5
> 3. **SHOW ACTUAL OUTPUT** from test commands (pass/fail counts)
> 4. **PRODUCE THE FINAL REPORT** in the exact format specified
>
> If you skip any step, the review is INCOMPLETE and INVALID.

# STEP 0: SCOPE DETECTION

**REQUIRED ACTION:** Use Bash tool to run these commands:

```bash
# Get changed files (committed)
git diff --name-only HEAD~1

# Get changed files (uncommitted)
git diff --name-only
git diff --name-only --cached
```

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:** Categorize the scope:

| Scope | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `frontend` | Only `frontend/**` files changed |
| `backend` | Only `backend/**` files changed |
| `contracts` | Any `api/contracts/**`, `generated/**`, or adapter files |
| `data` | Any `backend/data/**` or ETL scripts |
| `both` | Frontend + backend files changed |

**Store the scope** - you will use it in Step 5 to select the test tier.

---

# STEP 0.5: LOAD ENGINEERING CONTEXT

**REQUIRED ACTION:** Read the core engineering principles BEFORE reviewing code.

```
Tool: Read
file_path: claude.md (or CLAUDE.md)
```

**Extract and remember these sections:**

1. **§1 Core Invariants** - Non-negotiable rules (layer responsibilities, single source of truth)
2. **§1.6 Library-First** - Check if custom code could use a library
3. **§2 Hard Constraints** - Memory limits, data immutability
4. **§5 Backend Change Protocol** - The 4 questions before any backend change
5. **§7.2 API & Code Design** - 12 principles (single source of truth, fail fast, boring is good, etc.)
6. **§7.3 Param & Data Flow Integrity** - 5 principles (parse once, canonicalize at edges, one name per concept, immutable after normalization)
7. **§9 Historical Incidents** - Check REPO_MAP.md for landmines

**Why this matters:** Reviews that don't reference these principles miss systemic issues.
For example, a review might approve code that violates layer responsibilities or
recreates functionality that a library already provides.

**Key questions to keep in mind during review:**

| Principle | Question to Ask |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Layer Responsibilities | Does this component own logic it shouldn't? |
| Single Source of Truth | Is this data duplicated elsewhere? One canonical source? |
| Reuse-First | Does this match existing patterns in sibling files? |
| Library-First | Is this >50 lines of infrastructure that a library solves? |
| Production-Grade | Is this a band-aid fix or a proper solution? |
| Data Correctness | Are invariants computed before filters? Joins on IDs not names? |
| Don't Ship Unused | Is this actually used today, or "might be useful someday"? |
| One Job | Does this component do exactly one thing? |
| Fail Fast | Does this log-and-continue, or throw on errors? |
| Boring Is Good | Is this obvious code, or clever code? |
| Delete Before Add | Can we remove something instead of adding? |
| Explicit Dependencies | Are all inputs in the function signature? |
| Parse Once | Is this param parsed at entry, or transformed through multiple layers? |
| Canonicalize at Edges | Is data converted to final form at API boundary? |
| One Name Per Concept | Can you grep ONE name to find all usages? No aliases? |
| Immutable After Parse | Are params frozen after normalization, or mutated by layers? |
| Cache Key = Query Key | Does cache key use same resolved values as the actual query? |

---

# STEP 1: PATTERN ANALYSIS

**REQUIRED ACTION:** Use the Task tool with these EXACT parameters:

```
Tool: Task
subagent_type: "codebase-pattern-finder"
prompt: |
  Analyze the following changed files for pattern compliance:
  [LIST THE CHANGED FILES FROM STEP 0]

  1. Find 3+ sibling files in the same directory
  2. Run: git log -20 -- <changed_files>
  3. Extract common patterns from siblings
  4. Report any deviations from the majority pattern

  Output format:
  - Reference patterns found
  - Sibling examples
  - Deviations detected (if any)
```

**WAIT for agent to complete before proceeding to Step 2.**

---

# STEP 2: SIMPLICITY CHECK

**REQUIRED ACTION:** Use the Task tool with these EXACT parameters:

```
Tool: Task
subagent_type: "simplicity-reviewer"
prompt: |
  Review the following changed files for simplicity:
  [LIST THE CHANGED FILES FROM STEP 0]

  Check:
  1. Can this be done with fewer files?
  2. Can this be done with fewer lines?
  3. Is there a library solution? (Check CLAUDE.md §1.6)
  4. Does this match sibling patterns?
  5. Is this solving today's problem (not hypothetical future)?

  Output format:
  - Verdict: PASS | NEEDS SIMPLIFICATION | FLAGGED
  - Complexity: Lines, Files, Call depth
  - Simpler alternative (if found)
  - Library-First check: PASS | VIOLATION
  - Pattern match: ALIGNED | DIVERGENT
```

**WAIT for agent to complete.**

**IF FLAGGED:** Show the simpler alternative and ASK user before proceeding.

---

# STEP 3: CONTRACT & CONSISTENCY CHECK

**REQUIRED ACTION:** Use the Task tool with these EXACT parameters:

```
Tool: Task
subagent_type: "fullstack-consistency-reviewer"
prompt: |
  Check frontend↔backend contract alignment for:
  [LIST THE CHANGED FILES FROM STEP 0]

  Phase 0: Git state verification
  - Check uncommitted changes, file existence

  Phase 1: Contract consistency
  - Param names match (FE → BE)?
  - Response fields handled (BE → FE)?
  - Enum values match?
  - Adapters handle all fields?
  - Identity drift check: same concept uses ONE name across all layers?
    (grep for synonyms, check cache keys match query params)

  Phase 2: Chart impact (if backend changed)
  - What endpoints affected?
  - What charts consume them?
  - Risk level: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW

  Output: Contract issues, impact assessment
```

**WAIT for agent to complete before proceeding to Step 4.**

---

# STEP 4: RISK DETECTION

**REQUIRED ACTION:** Use the Task tool with these EXACT parameters.

**CRITICAL:** Include context from Steps 0.5-3 so risk-agent doesn't make false positives.

```
Tool: Task
subagent_type: "risk-agent"
prompt: |
  ## Context from Previous Review Steps

  ### Engineering Principles (from Step 0.5)
  [PASTE key principles from CLAUDE.md that were extracted]

  ### Pattern Analysis Findings (from Step 1)
  [PASTE the output from codebase-pattern-finder]
  - What patterns are established in sibling files?
  - What git history shows about these files?

  ### Simplicity Check Findings (from Step 2)
  [PASTE the output from simplicity-reviewer]
  - Library-First violations found?
  - Is this solving today's problem or hypothetical future?

  ### Contract Check Findings (from Step 3)
  [PASTE the output from fullstack-consistency-reviewer]
  - Any contract drift detected?
  - What's the current migration state?

  ### Technology Context (CRITICAL for avoiding false positives)
  - Storage type: [sessionStorage clears on close / localStorage persists]
  - Migration state: [React Query X/Y migrated, mixed patterns EXPECTED]
  - Framework facts:
    - Tree-shaking removes unused imports (don't flag dead imports)
    - import.meta.env.DEV code doesn't run in prod
    - Zustand persist hydration is synchronous (no race possible)
    - Page-namespaced stores are isolated (no cross-page leak)

  ## Files to Review
  [LIST THE CHANGED FILES FROM STEP 0]

  ## Default Stance: SKEPTICAL

  Assume code has bugs until proven otherwise.

  1. Verify each change has test coverage
  2. Check edge cases explicitly
  3. Confirm patterns match codebase standards
  4. Question complexity — is there a simpler way?
  5. Only APPROVE when confident

  **One sentence:** A good reviewer finds the bugs the author missed, not confirms their assumptions.

  ## Your Role
  Be a senior code reviewer with a skeptical mindset. Look for:
  1. Real bugs that will break in production
  2. Inefficiencies that should be improved
  3. Better ways to implement the same functionality
  4. Security vulnerabilities
  5. Performance issues

  ## Reality Check Protocol (Prevents False Positives)
  Before reporting ANY finding, verify:
  1. READ the actual code (not just grep output)
  2. Check 20 lines of context for guards
  3. Verify the technology behaves as you assume (use the context provided)
  4. Confirm it's not already addressed by previous step findings
  5. Exclude comments, test files, and dead code from findings

  ## Output Format (Simplified)

  ### P0: Must Fix Before Merge
  🔴 **file:line** — [issue]
     Code: `[snippet]`
     Fix: `[solution]`

  ### P1: Should Fix
  🟡 **file:line** — [issue]

  ### Verified Not Issues (show your work)
  - Checked [pattern] at file:line → [why it's OK]

  ### Verdict: APPROVE | REQUEST CHANGES | NEEDS DISCUSSION
```

**WAIT for agent to complete before proceeding to Step 5.**

# STEP 5: RUN INLINE TESTS

**REQUIRED ACTION:** Use Bash tool to execute tests based on scope from Step 0.

## Tier Selection Logic

| Scope from Step 0 | Run These Tiers |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| `frontend` only | Tier 1 + Tier 2 (frontend only) |
| `backend` only | Tier 1 + Tier 2 (backend only) |
| `contracts` touched | Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 |
| `both` | Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 |
| `data` changed | Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 |
| Pre-merge | Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 + Tier 4 |

---

## Tier 1: Quick Checks (ALWAYS RUN - ~30s)

**REQUIRED:** Use Bash tool to run:

```bash
# Frontend lint + typecheck
cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run typecheck
```

```bash
# Backend syntax check (catches syntax errors, NOT runtime errors like NameError)
python -m py_compile backend/routes/*.py backend/services/*.py
```

```bash
# Contract drift check
python backend/scripts/generate_contracts.py --check
```

```bash
# Historical landmine check - warns if changes touch files from past incidents
python backend/scripts/check_landmines.py
```

**Record pass/fail for each command.**

**NOTE:** `py_compile` only catches **syntax errors**. Runtime errors like NameError, TypeError
are caught by endpoint smoke tests in Tier 2.

---

## Tier 2: Core Tests (DEFAULT - ~3 min)

**REQUIRED:** Use Bash tool to run:

### Backend Tests (if backend changed):
```bash
cd backend && pytest tests/test_normalize.py tests/test_api_contract.py -v
```

```bash
cd backend && pytest tests/test_sql_guardrails.py tests/test_sql_safety.py -v
```

```bash
cd backend && pytest tests/test_property_age_bucket.py tests/test_param_coverage.py -v
```

### Contract STRICT Mode (if routes/schemas changed):
```bash
# Validates ALL contracted endpoints return schema-compliant responses
# Catches undeclared fields that slip through in WARN mode
cd backend && CONTRACT_MODE=strict pytest tests/contracts/test_all_endpoints_strict.py -v --tb=short
```

**Why this matters:** On Jan 3, 2026, `/api/auth/subscription` was returning undeclared
`_debug_*` fields. The decorator logged warnings but nothing failed. This test catches
that class of bug by running all endpoints in STRICT mode.

### Endpoint Smoke Test (if routes changed):
```bash
# Catches runtime errors (NameError, TypeError, AttributeError) that py_compile misses
# Actually CALLS every endpoint - static analysis can't catch these
cd backend && pytest tests/contracts/test_endpoint_smoke.py -v --tb=short
```

**Why this matters:** On Jan 3, 2026, `/api/projects/hot` had `NameError: district_param`.
`py_compile` passed because it only checks syntax. This test actually calls the endpoint.

### Route Coverage Check (if new routes added):
```bash
# Ensures new routes have @api_contract decorator (or documented exemption)
cd backend && pytest tests/contracts/test_route_coverage.py -v
```

**Why this matters:** Prevents new endpoints from bypassing contract validation.

### Frontend Tests (if frontend changed):
```bash
# Unit tests (adapter transforms, filter logic, etc.)
cd frontend && npm run test:ci
```

```bash
# Quick E2E smoke - catches React crashes, context errors, white-screen
# Runs critical pages with mocked API, checks for console errors
cd frontend && npm run build && npm run test:e2e:smoke
```

**Why E2E smoke in Tier 2:** Unit tests don't catch React context errors, missing providers,
or "white page" crashes. The smoke test actually renders pages and checks for:
- React error boundaries
- Console errors (`Cannot read properties of`, `is not a function`)
- White-screen (body has no content)

### Scripts:
```bash
python scripts/check_route_contract.py
```

```bash
python scripts/data_guard.py --ci
```

**Record pass/fail for each command.**

---

## Tier 3: Full Suite (COMPLEX CHANGES - ~8 min)

**REQUIRED when:** contracts touched, both FE+BE changed, data changed, or pre-merge.

**Use Bash tool to run:**

### Integration Tests:
```bash
cd backend && pytest tests/test_regression_snapshots.py -v
```

```bash
cd backend && pytest tests/test_api_invariants.py -v
```

```bash
cd backend && pytest tests/test_smoke_endpoints.py -v
```

```bash
cd backend && pytest tests/test_chart_dependencies.py -v
```

```bash
cd backend && pytest tests/test_kpi_guardrails.py -v
```

### E2E Smoke:
```bash
cd frontend && npm run build && npm run e2e:smoke
```

### Mock Validation:
```bash
python scripts/validate_e2e_mocks.py
```

**Record pass/fail for each command.**

---

## Tier 4: Full E2E Runtime (PRE-MERGE - ~10 min)

**REQUIRED when:** User explicitly requests, major UI changes, filter/state changes.

```bash
cd frontend && npm run e2e:full
```

---

## Bug Detection Matrix

What each test/check catches:

| Bug Type | Static Analysis | Test That Catches It |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **BACKEND** | | |
| **Syntax errors** | `py_compile` ✅ | - |
| **Import errors** | `py_compile` ✅ | - |
| **NameError** (undefined var) | ❌ Misses | `test_endpoint_smoke.py` |
| **TypeError** (wrong args) | ❌ Misses | `test_endpoint_smoke.py` |
| **AttributeError** | ❌ Misses | `test_endpoint_smoke.py` |
| **KeyError** | ❌ Misses | `test_endpoint_smoke.py` |
| **Undeclared response fields** | ❌ Misses | `test_all_endpoints_strict.py` |
| **Missing contract decorator** | ❌ Misses | `test_route_coverage.py` |
| **SQL injection** | ❌ Misses | `test_sql_safety.py` |
| **FRONTEND** | | |
| **Lint violations** | `npm run lint` ✅ | - |
| **Type errors (TS)** | `npm run typecheck` ✅ | - |
| **React context errors** | ❌ Misses | `e2e/smoke.spec.js` |
| **White-screen crashes** | ❌ Misses | `e2e/smoke.spec.js` |
| **Missing providers** | ❌ Misses | `e2e/smoke.spec.js` |
| **Console errors** | ❌ Misses | `e2e/smoke.spec.js` |
| **CROSS-CUTTING** | | |
| **Schema drift** | ❌ Misses | `generate_contracts.py --check` |
| **Param mismatch FE↔BE** | ❌ Misses | `check_route_contract.py` |
| **Data regression** | ❌ Misses | `test_regression_snapshots.py` |
| **Historical landmines** | ❌ Misses | `check_landmines.py` |
| **Security issues** | ❌ Misses | `risk-agent` (Step 4) |

**Key insight:** Static analysis (`py_compile`, `ast.parse`) only catches syntax errors.
Runtime errors require actually calling the endpoints (smoke tests).

## 🎯 TL;DR — What's This About?

### The Problem (ELI5)

> **Restaurant Analogy:** [Choose appropriate analogy based on the issue type]
>
> Think of our app like a restaurant:
> - **Frontend** = The dining room (what customers see)
> - **Backend** = The kitchen (where orders are processed)
> - **API Contract** = The order ticket (how waiter communicates with kitchen)
> - **Database** = The pantry (where ingredients are stored)
>
> **What was broken:**
> [Describe the issue using the analogy. Examples:]
> - "The waiter was writing orders in French, but the kitchen only reads English"
> - "The bouncer was letting everyone in without checking IDs"
> - "The kitchen was sending out dishes the menu didn't list"
>
> **In technical terms:**
> [1-2 sentence technical description]

### Analogy Reference Guide

| Issue Type | Analogy | Role |
|------------|---------|------|
| Contract mismatch | Order ticket | Waiter ↔ Kitchen communication |
| Auth/Security | Bouncer | Checks IDs at the door |
| Data validation | Quality inspector | Checks ingredients before cooking |
| Caching | Prep station | Pre-made items for speed |
| API response | Plated dish | What gets served to customer |
| Frontend state | Table status | Reserved, occupied, ready to clear |
| Database | Pantry/Inventory | Raw ingredients storage |
| Services | Line cooks | Each handles specific dish types |
| Routes | Order window | Where tickets come in |
