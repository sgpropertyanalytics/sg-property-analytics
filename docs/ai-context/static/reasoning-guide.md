# Chart Interpretation Reasoning Guide

## Cardinal Rule: No Citation, No Claim

**If a claim depends on policy, rates, or market news, you MUST include a citation. If no relevant source was provided in context, state that explicitly rather than making unsupported claims.**

Examples:
- WITH context: "ABSD for foreigners is 60% (IRAS, effective 27 Apr 2023)"
- WITHOUT context: "Policy rates apply but specific rates were not provided in context"
- NEVER: "ABSD is around 60%" (unsourced claim)

## General Principles

1. **Start with the data**: Describe what the chart shows before interpreting
2. **Acknowledge limitations**: Note sample size, time range, data gaps
3. **Provide context**: Compare to benchmarks, historical ranges, peer groups
4. **Avoid predictions**: Focus on what IS, not what WILL BE
5. **Cite sources**: Reference policy snippets, market context with dates
6. **No citation, no claim**: If external context wasn't provided, say so

## Time Series Charts

### What to look for:
- **Trend direction**: Rising, falling, or flat
- **Volatility**: Smooth vs choppy movement
- **Seasonality**: Q1/Q4 patterns (bonus season, school year)
- **Breakpoints**: Sudden changes (often policy-related)

### How to describe:
- "Over the [timeframe], [metric] has [direction] from [start] to [end]"
- "Notable [acceleration/deceleration] occurred in [period]"
- "Current level is [above/below] the [X]-month average"

## Distribution Charts

### What to look for:
- **Central tendency**: Where most transactions cluster
- **Spread**: Tight vs wide distribution
- **Skew**: Left-tail (bargains) vs right-tail (premiums)
- **Outliers**: Extreme values that may distort averages

### How to describe:
- "The median PSF of $X suggests..."
- "The interquartile range of $Y indicates [tight/wide] pricing"
- "The [left/right] skew suggests [buyer/seller] market dynamics"

## Comparison Charts (Region/Bedroom)

### What to look for:
- **Relative positioning**: Which segment leads/lags
- **Spread changes**: Compression or divergence over time
- **Volume distribution**: Where activity concentrates

### How to describe:
- "CCR trades at [X]% premium to OCR, [above/below] historical average"
- "3BR units show [stronger/weaker] volume relative to 2BR"
- "The [narrowing/widening] spread suggests..."

## Beads Charts (Transaction Scatter)

### What to look for:
- **Density clusters**: Where most transactions occur
- **Price bands**: Floor and ceiling patterns
- **Outliers**: Unusually high or low transactions
- **Time progression**: Recent vs older transactions

### How to describe:
- "Transactions cluster around $X PSF with floor at $Y"
- "Recent transactions (colored) show [higher/lower/similar] pricing"
- "The [bedroom] segment shows [tighter/wider] price dispersion"

## Data Quality Considerations

Always note when:
- Sample size is small (<30 transactions)
- Time range is limited
- Data may be incomplete (recent months)
- Outliers significantly affect statistics

Example: "Based on [N] transactions over [period]. Note: [limitation]."

## Connecting to Context

When policy or market context is provided:
- Reference specific snippets with dates
- Explain mechanism (how policy affects metric)
- Avoid speculation beyond provided context

Example: "Following the [policy change] in [date], the data shows [observation]. This aligns with [expected mechanism]."

When no relevant context is provided:
- State observation without causal claims
- Note that external factors may apply
- Do not invent policy or market explanations
