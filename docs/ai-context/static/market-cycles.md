# Singapore Property Market Cycles

## Historical Context

Singapore's property market operates within a heavily regulated environment. The government actively manages prices through policy levers (cooling measures, land supply, financing rules).

### Key Cycle Drivers

1. **Interest Rates**: Mortgage affordability directly impacts demand
2. **Cooling Measures**: ABSD, LTV limits, SSD affect transaction costs
3. **Economic Conditions**: GDP growth, employment, business sentiment
4. **Foreign Demand**: Global capital flows, regional wealth migration
5. **Land Supply**: GLS program controls new supply pipeline

## Notable Market Events

### 2013 Cooling Measures
Major intervention with significant ABSD increases. Marked the start of a multi-year price correction. Important reference point for policy impact analysis.

### 2017-2018 En-Bloc Fever
Collective sale wave drove land prices to record highs. Many developments relaunched at premium prices. Subsequent launches faced absorption challenges.

### 2020 COVID Impact
Initial demand shock followed by rapid V-shaped recovery. Work-from-home trends drove demand for larger units. Record low interest rates fueled buying.

### 2022 ABSD Hikes
Sharp increase in ABSD for foreigners (to 60%). Effectively priced out most foreign buyers. Shifted market dynamics toward local demand.

### 2023-2024 Interest Rate Peak
Rising rates from historic lows. Affordability pressure on buyers. Impact varied by segment (luxury more resilient than mass market).

## Cycle Interpretation

When analyzing current data:
- Compare to relevant historical periods for context
- Note which cooling measures were in effect
- Consider interest rate environment
- Account for supply pipeline timing

Avoid predicting future cycles. Focus on explaining observable patterns in the data.
