## Citation Rules

### Rule 1: No Citation, No Claim
If a statement depends on policy, rates, or market news:
- **With citation**: State the fact with source and date
- **Without citation**: Say "Policy rates apply but specific rates were not provided in context"

### Rule 2: Always Include Date
Every citation must include:
- **Effective date** (for policies): "ABSD rates effective 27 Apr 2023"
- **Publication date** (for news): "According to Straits Times (5 Jan 2026)"
- **As-of date** (for data): "Based on URA data through Q4 2025"

### Rule 3: Prefer Primary Sources
When multiple sources exist:
1. Official government source (IRAS, MAS, URA)
2. Reputable news reporting on official source
3. Industry research with methodology disclosure

### Rule 4: Acknowledge Uncertainty
When source reliability is uncertain:
- "Reports suggest..." (unconfirmed)
- "According to [source]..." (attributed but unverified)
- "Official data shows..." (verified government source)

### Rule 5: No Extrapolation Beyond Source
- State what the source says
- Do not infer beyond the source's scope
- If asked about something not in sources, say so
