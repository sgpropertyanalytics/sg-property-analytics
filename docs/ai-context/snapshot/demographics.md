## Foreign Buyer Concentration by Region

| Region | Foreign Buyer Share | Typical Profile |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------|
| CCR (Core Central) | Higher (~8-12%) | Ultra-wealthy, investment |
| RCR (Rest of Central) | Moderate (~5-7%) | Expats, PRs upgrading |
| OCR (Outside Central) | Lower (~3-5%) | PRs, family-oriented |

### Districts with High Foreign Interest
- **D09 (Orchard)**: Trophy assets, Chinese/Indonesian UHNW
- **D10 (Bukit Timah)**: Good schools, expat families
- **D01/D02 (CBD/Marina)**: Investment, rental yield focus
- **D15 (East Coast)**: Lifestyle, Malaysian buyers
- **D21 (Clementi)**: Education hub, Chinese families

---

## PR Buyer Patterns

- PRs face 5% ABSD on first property (vs 0% for citizens)
- Strong preference for RCR/OCR mass market ($1-2M range)
- Often upgrade from HDB after meeting MOP
- Key districts: D19, D20, D23 (family-oriented suburbs)

---

## Market Implications

### Post-60% ABSD Environment
1. **Foreigner demand collapsed** in mid-market, survived only in ultra-luxury
2. **PR buyers became key swing factor** - lower ABSD, growing population
3. **Citizen upgraders dominate** mass market volume
4. **American buyers emerging** as top foreign nationality (tax/lifestyle reasons)

### Why This Matters for Pricing
- CCR luxury resilient due to UHNW foreign demand (price insensitive)
- RCR/OCR more sensitive to local demand/income growth
- PR population stability = steady demand floor in mass market
