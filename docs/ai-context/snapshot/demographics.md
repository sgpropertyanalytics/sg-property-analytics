- **D01/D02 (CBD/Marina)**: Investment, rental yield focus
- **D15 (East Coast)**: Lifestyle, Malaysian buyers

## PR Buyer Patterns

- PRs face 5% ABSD on first property (vs 0% for citizens)

## Market Implications

### Population-Driven Demand
- **3.66 million citizens** = core demand base for owner-occupied homes
- **544K PRs** = key upgrader segment, price-sensitive
- **1.91 million non-residents** = rental demand + luxury purchases

### Post-60% ABSD Environment
1. **Foreigner demand collapsed** in mid-market, survived only in ultra-luxury
2. **PR buyers became key swing factor** - lower ABSD, stable population
3. **Citizen upgraders dominate** mass market volume
4. **American buyers emerging** as top foreign nationality
